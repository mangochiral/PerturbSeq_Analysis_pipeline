# Perturb-seq Analysis Pipeline Template

## General Note

This repository serves as a **template** for processing and analyzing Perturb-seq data. The intent is for this codebase to act as a general starting point:  
- **Do not edit scripts in this repository for project-specific needs.**  
- Instead, **copy or fork this repository** into a new, project-specific folder or repo, and make any project-specific edits there.  
This ensures that the template remains general-purpose and reusable for anyone starting a new Perturb-seq analysis project.

## Purpose

The scripts and workflows provided here are designed to cover the full pipeline for preprocessing, analyzing, and visualizing data from CRISPR-based Perturb-seq experiments. The focus is on modularity and generalizability:
- Fundamentally there are 4 general steps:
1. Preprocessing of raw 10x h5ad and splitting them to gene expression AnnData objects and CRISPR AnnData objects.
2. Guide Assignment: This workflow uses a mixture model of Poisson-Gaussian distribution for assignment to cells. **Prior to running guide assignment, the CRISPR AnnData object must be edited according to the CRISPR modality used (CRISPRi, CRISPRa, or KO), as each type requires different processing and filtering considerations.** The threshold of guide UMI counts for filtering out cells should also be set according to the experiment design. Additional processing of the guide-assigned AnnData object will be required before downstream steps.
3. Pseudobulking: The current workflow is a template; confounders, technical and biological replicates should be considered and pseudobulking should be done accordingly. **Prior prep is required before DGE analysis** for example non effective or non highly variable genes, refer to the `prep_DE_merge_pseudobulk.ipynb` in `src/pseudobulk`.
4. DGE analysis: This workflow uses DESeq2 for differential analysis caused by perturbation.

## Best Practices

- **Use metadata:** Specify experiment type and other details in metadata files or AnnData objects, not in scripts.
- **Fork, then customize:** For a new project, fork or copy this repo, then make modifications in your project copy only.
- **Multiple script versions:** Provide both notebook (.ipynb) and script (.py) versions of analyses where possible, to support different user needs and computational environments. Examples:
  - Notebooks for interactive or exploratory analysis.
  - SLURM job scripts for high-throughput or large-scale processing.

## Notes

- **Jupyter notebooks (`.ipynb`)** are provided for interactive analyses and visualizations.
- **Scripts are designed to be modular.** Run only the steps relevant for your experiment.
- **Metadata-driven:** Each step should rely on experiment information provided via files/AnnData.

**To contribute improvements:**  
Generalize scripts further, improve modularity, or add new template scripts/notebooks—but avoid project-specific edits here.
